# RadiusDatingApp

Radius is a dating, networking, and friendship application. My main idea behind this app is to create accessibility to new connections by designing a way to connect with people you're already around within a bar, coffee shop, or other commerical establishment. By geofencing your particular "bar hop" and creating a radius around it, it allows for interaction within a safe and designated space, allowing a user to become invisible just by walking outside of the radius.

The full concept and explanation of this application can be found in this blog post: http://www.thelifeofkiki.com/portfoliodetails/2019/10/25/radius-dating-app-swift
